OpenDNS Top Domains List
========================

The OpenDNS Top Domains List is the top 10,000 domain names our
resolvers all over the globe are receiving queries for, sorted by
popularity.

The popularity is defined as the number of unique client IPs having
looked up a domain over a 1 hour period. Domain names that we flagged
as being used to serve or control malware are removed from the list.

OpenDNS Random Sample List
==========================

The OpenDNS Random Sample List is a random sample of 10,000 domain
names.

Similar to the OpenDNS Top Domains List, domains that we flagged as
suspicious are not present in the list, that can be used as a benign
data set.

Both lists are in public domain, and are updated weekly.

They are not meant to replace other public lists in any way. The Top
Domains List, in particular, is solely based on DNS queries and
doesnâ€™t reflect the popularity of websites.

However, these lists have been useful to train, test and improve our
own models, and by sharing them, we hope that other researchers will
find them a useful addition as well.
